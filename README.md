## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned that in order to resize properly the height of the body it's better to use "min-height: 100vh". Don't know if it is the best solution but at least this way I can make the body to have the same height of the page either on desktop screens and phone screens.

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to refine my knowledge about responsiveness. I don't master properly the usage of properties like max-width or media queries.
I would like to begin exploring also media queries on components.
